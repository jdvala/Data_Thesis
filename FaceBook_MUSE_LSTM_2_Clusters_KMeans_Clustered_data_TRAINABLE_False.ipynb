              "\"Use of passenger records to prevent terrorism and serious crime Use of passenger records to prevent terrorism and serious crime SUMMARY OF: Directive (EU) 2016/681 on the use of passenger name record (PNR) data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE DIRECTIVE? It aims to regulate the transfer of the passenger name record (PNR) data of passengers on international flights from airlines to the European Union (EU) countries. It also regulates the processing of these data by EU countries competent authorities. KEY POINTS What are PNR data? They consist of booking information stored by airlines in their reservation and departure control systems. The information collected includes: travel dates; travel itinerary; ticket information; contact details; means of payment used; baggage information. Scope Each EU country must establish Passenger Information Unit (PIU). PIU is responsible for: collecting, storing and processing the data, as well as transferring the data or the results of the processing to the competent national authorities; exchanging PNR data and the results of processing with other EU countries and Europol. Airlines must provide PIUs in EU countries with the PNR data for flights entering or departing from the EU. It also allows but does not require EU countries to collect PNR data concerning selected intra-EU flights. Processing The data collected may only be processed to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorist offences and serious crime. Data should only be processed in the following cases: for pre-arrival assessment of passengers against pre-determined risk criteria and relevant law enforcement databases; for use in specific investigations/prosecutions; as input in the development of risk assessment criteria. Transfer and exchange of data EU countries should not be able to access the database of airline companies. PNR data are sent by the airline to the PIU of the EU country concerned. When necessary and relevant, an EU country must supply PNR data on an identified person to the competent authorities of another EU country. PNR data may be transferred to non-EU country under certain specific conditions. Storage Data provided by airline carriers must be stored in database by PIU for years from the time of its transfer to the EU country in which the flight is landing or departing. After months the transferred data must be ‘depersonalised to mask out certain information including; name; address and contact information; all payment information including billing address. Disclosure of the full PNR information after this 6-month period has expired is only permitted if: it is reasonably believed to be necessary in order to respond to requests for PNR data made by competent authorities or Europol on case-by-case basis and; it has been approved by judicial or other national authority competent under national law to verify whether the conditions for disclosure are met. FROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY? The directive has applied since 24 May 2016. EU countries have to incorporate it into national law by 25 May 2018. BACKGROUND For more information, see: ‘Passenger Name Record (PNR) on the European Commission's website MAIN DOCUMENT Directive (EU) 2016/681 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the use of passenger name record (PNR) data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime (OJ 119, 4.5.2016, pp. 132-149) last update 13.12.2016\\n\\n\\nVerwendung von Fluggastdatensätzen zur Verhütung von Terrorismus und schwerer Kriminalität Verwendung von Fluggastdatensätzen zur Verhütung von Terrorismus und schwerer Kriminalität ZUSAMMENFASSUNG DES DOKUMENTS: Richtlinie (EU) 2016/681 über die Verwendung von Fluggastdatensätzen (PNR-Daten) zur Verhütung, Aufdeckung, Ermittlung und Verfolgung von terroristischen Straftaten und schwerer Kriminalität WAS IST DER ZWECK DIESER RICHTLINIE? Ziel der Richtlinie ist, die Übermittlung von Fluggastdatensätzen (PNR-Daten) zu Fluggästen von internationalen Flügen durch Fluggesellschaften an die Länder der Europäischen Union (EU) zu regeln. Zudem wird die Verarbeitung dieser Daten durch die zuständigen Behörden der EU-Länder geregelt. WICHTIGE ECKPUNKTE Was sind PNR-Daten? PNR-Daten bestehen aus den in den Buchungs- und Abfertigungssystemen der Fluggesellschaften gespeicherten Buchungsinformationen. Es werden folgende Daten erhoben: Abflugdaten; Reiseverlauf; Flugscheindaten; Kontaktinformationen; verwendetes Zahlungsmittel; Gepäckangaben. Anwendungsbereich Jedes EU-Land muss eine PNR-Zentralstelle errichten. Die PNR-Zentralstelle ist verantwortlich für: die Erhebung, Speicherung und Verarbeitung der Daten sowie die Übermittlung der Daten oder der Ergebnisse ihrer Verarbeitung an die zuständigen nationalen Behörden; den Austausch von PNR-Daten und den Ergebnissen der Verarbeitung mit anderen EU-Ländern und mit Europol. Die Fluggesellschaften müssen den PNR-Zentralstellen in den EU-Ländern die PNR-Daten zu Flügen, die aus der EU ankommen beziehungsweise aus der EU abgegangen sind, zur Verfügung stellen. Die EU-Länder können zudem PNR-Daten zu ausgewählten EU-Flügen erheben, sind dazu allerdings nicht verpflichtet. Verarbeitung Die Verarbeitung der erhobenen Daten darf nur zur Verhütung, Aufdeckung, Ermittlung und Verfolgung von terroristischen Straftaten und schwerer Kriminalität erfolgen. Die Daten sollten ausschließlich zu folgenden Zwecken verarbeitet werden: Überprüfung von Fluggästen vor ihrer Ankunft anhand im Voraus festgelegter Kriterien und der Datenbanken der Strafverfolgungsbehörden; Verwendung für konkrete Ermittlungs- und Strafverfolgungszwecke; Verwendung als Beitrag bei der Entwicklung von Kriterien zur Risikobewertung. Übermittlung und Austausch von Daten Die EU-Länder sollten keinen Zugriff auf die Datenbanken der Fluggesellschaften haben. Die PNR-Daten werden von der Fluggesellschaft an die PNR-Zentralstelle des betreffenden EU-Landes übermittelt. Falls erforderlich und relevant, muss ein EU-Land die PNR-Daten von ermittelten Personen an die zuständigen Behörden eines anderen EU-Landes übermitteln. PNR-Daten dürfen nur unter bestimmten Bedingungen an ein Nicht-EU-Land übermittelt werden. Speicherung Die von Fluggesellschaften übermittelten Daten müssen von der PNR-Zentralstelle für einen Zeitraum von fünf Jahren ab ihrer Übermittlung an das EU-Land, in dem der Flug angekommen beziehungsweise von dem er abgegangen ist, in einer Datenbank gespeichert werden. Nach sechs Monaten müssen die Daten „depersonalisiert“ werden, um bestimmte Informationen unkenntlich zu machen, darunter: Name; Anschrift und Kontaktdaten; alle Zahlungsinformationen einschließlich Rechnungsanschrift. Nach Ablauf der vorgenannten Frist von sechs Monaten ist die Offenlegung der vollständigen PNR-Daten nur zulässig, wenn berechtigter Grund zu der Annahme besteht, dass dies im Einzelfall für die Beantwortung von Anfragen von PNR-Daten durch die zuständigen Behörden oder Europol erforderlich ist, und dies durch eine Justizbehörde oder eine andere nationale Behörde genehmigt wird, die nach nationalem Recht dafür zuständig ist zu überprüfen, ob die Bedingungen für die Offenlegung erfüllt sind. WANN TRITT DIE RICHTLINIE IN KRAFT? Die Richtlinie ist am 24. Mai 2016 in Kraft getreten. Die EU-Länder müssen sie bis 25. Mai 2018 in nationales Recht umsetzen.
